# Influencers_Backend
The basic project setup for Influencers Backend is as follows:


# Setting up a database
This project mainly uses PostgreSQL. To connect this backend with your local database add a .env file in the root directory.
The structure of the .env file will be as follows:

SECRET_KEY=
NAME=
USER=
PASSWORD=
HOST=localhost
PORT=5432

None of this needs to be enclosed in commas or speech marks. Also note that HOST and PORT may also need to be changed according to your contextual requirements.


# Setting up environment
You need to set up a python virtual environment in your root directory using any venv of your choice.
I prefer using: "virtualenv venv" if you have virtualenv installed first.

After venv has set up, activate it and run:
pip install -r requirements.txt

It will install all the required libraries and dependencies for your django project.


# Installing new libraries and dependencies
If you have install a new library using pip or any other installer package. Make sure to add it in requirements.txt.
Please don't use "pip freeze > requirements.txt" as it will add the versions too, and this can cause conflicts in the future releases.
